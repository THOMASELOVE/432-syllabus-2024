What separates “doing data science” from “doing data analysis” is programming.\n\nThis is NOT a course in mathematical statistics or statistical inference. It’s far more applied than that."

Love, Ph.D. and I have at least three different jobs.\n\nI am a Professor in the Departments of Medicine and of Population & Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. I teach three courses per year there (PQHS 431, 432 and 500) and also lead the Health Care Analytics track of the MS program in Biostatistics.\nI direct Biostatistics and Data Science at the Population Health Research Institute and at the Center for Health Care Research and Policy at The MetroHealth System.\nFor ten years, I was the (founding) Data Director for Better Health Partnership, an alliance of people who provide, pay for and receive care in Northeast Ohio. I still consult occasionally with them and hold the position of Chief Data Scientist there.\nI am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and have won numerous awards for my teaching and my research, including the 2018 John S. Diekhoff Award for Graduate Teaching from CWRU.\nI have been teaching at CWRU since 1994, and have taught every manner of CWRU student over the years, especially students in biostatistics, medicine, and management.\n\nIn research, I use statistical methods to look at questions in health policy and in particular the provision of health services. I mostly work with observational data, rather than data that emerge from randomized clinical trials, and I have a special interest in working with data from electronic health records.\n\nYou may be interested in a study in Health Affairs showing the impact of a Medicaid-like expansion plan on care and outcomes of poor patients in Cleveland.\nOr you might be interested in our New England Journal of Medicine study of the effect of electronic health records on the care and outcomes of people with diabetes.\nIn 2011, James O’Malley and I chaired the Ninth International Conference on Health Policy Statistics, here in Cleveland. Here’s a recap.\nI’ve also worked on many projects involving the use of propensity scores to make causal inferences from observational studies, particularly in heart failure.\n\nIf you want to see a pretty complete list of my publications, knock yourself out.\nI hold degrees from Columbia University in the City of New York and from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation adviser was Paul Rosenbaum. I am married to a brilliant woman who is an attorney at Savant Systems, and we are raising two terrific sons. The elder has graduated college and works and lives in Pittsburgh, and the younger is in his senior year at Columbia University. Both kids are in the midst of applying to graduate programs for Fall 2024. We live in Shaker Heights. I sing and act occasionally in community theater including a musical this February, do lots of puzzles and play golf when I can."

In this class, a Minute Paper is a short survey (completed using a Google Form) where you will answer a few questions about how the course is going for you. To complete the Minute Paper, you’ll need to log into Google with your CWRU account. The Welcome to 432 Survey uses a similar format, but is more extensive than a typical Minute Paper.\nEach Minute Paper ideally takes less than five minutes to complete, and is best done right at the end of Tuesday’s class. The Minute Papers are actually due at noon on Wednesdays to give you some time to reflect, if you’d like, or if you’re in a hurry at the end of Tuesday’s class.\nYou should complete the Minute Paper even if you weren’t able to attend the most recent class.\nOnly Professor Love sees the results of the Minute Papers with identifying information. He then summarizes findings without identifying people and addresses those as part of the README discussion in the Thursday class whenever possible.\nProfessor Love reserves the right to change the number of minute papers depending on how the class is going during the semester."

Students in this class are not in competition with each other for grades. I have no set percentage of students who will receive any particular grade. We aim for substantial and timely feedback from the teaching assistants and myself on all elements of the course.\nThe course grade is based on four key areas of demonstrated accomplishment.\nCourse grades are based primarily on performance on labs, projects and quizzes. Your grade on each of these three elements will be determined separately. Then we will combine these elements as follows:\n\n\n\nElement\nWeight 1\nWeight 2\nWeight 3\nWeight 4\n\n\n\n\nLabs\n35%\n30%\n25%\n-\n\n\nProjects\n45%\n40%\n35%\n-\n\n\nQuizzes\n25%\n20%\n15%\n-\n\n\nParticipation\n-\n-\n-\n10%\n\n\n\nAmong Labs, Projects and Quizzes, your element with the strongest score will receive Weight 1, your element with the second strongest score will receive Weight 2 and your element with the weakest score will receive weight 3. The Class Participation score (which includes the Minute Papers) is worth 10% for all students.\nProfessor Love will then determine your final course grade using the following scale:\n\ncourse averages of 88.0% to 100% will receive a A\ncourse averages of 85.0% to 87.9% will be reviewed more closely to determine whether the grade will be A or B\ncourse averages of 70.0% to 84.9% will receive a B\n\nFor students in the 85.0-87.9% range, students who have improved from the first half of the course to the second will be more likely to receive an A than those whose performance has declined.\nStudents whose course average is near or below 70% usually have failed to complete some element of the course, and need to take an Incomplete to complete their work before I assign a final grade. We follow the University’s Incomplete Policy, as described here."

    "text": "8.5 Lab Appeal Policy - Request a Review via Google Form\nClarification of concerns related to potential typographical or other errors in our Lab answer sketches is welcome at any time, but haggling over points on assignments can be a real time sink in a large class. To that end, students are requested not to dispute any grading on Labs 1-7 during the semester. Instead, should you receive a lower grade on a Lab than you feel you deserve based on the feedback the TA provides, the answer sketch and the grading rubric, you can submit a request for a regrade by Professor Love by submitting the Google Form found at https://bit.ly/432-2024-lab-regrades by the deadline in the Calendar.\nStudents are welcome to ask questions of Professor Love about grading during the term. The TAs and Professor Love are happy to discuss in a general sense any questions about an assignment, but no grades will be changed until the end of the term. - The one exception is if there is a mistake in adding up points, or some similar clerical error. If you find such an issue, please bring it to Professor Love’s attention via email, and such problems will be corrected immediately.\nIn May, after Professor Love has worked out what letter grade to give each student, he will go through the requests on the form and determine for each whether the student’s letter grade would change if all of the points in dispute were granted. If the answer is no, then he won’t even look at the disputed grade(s). If the answer is yes, then he will look very carefully to see if enough extra points are merited to change a grade. (It will not help your case to submit frivolous requests.)\nThe main advantage of this system is that it saves all of us the hassle of haggling over points that are never going to mean anything anyway. It also provides “equal access” to students who are too timid to express their concerns. Finally, if there is an issue with grading a particular problem or assignment that needs to be reconsidered, Professor Love will have access to all papers and can make a universal decision1."

Unauthorized absence from a final examination will result in a failing grade. When the student completes the work, the Incomplete is changed to an A, B, C, D, P, F, or NP.\n\n\nAll work for the incomplete grade must be made up and the change of grade recorded in the Office of the University Registrar by the date specified by the instructor, but no later than the last day of class in the semester following the one in which the Incomplete was received. A student who has a permanent Incomplete for a required course must retake the course in a later term. If the student cannot complete the work by the end of the following semester, he or she must petition for an extension which must be endorsed by the instructor, explain the reasons why the work has not been completed, and include a new date for completion. Students will be allowed only one extension of no more than one additional semester to complete the work for an Incomplete grade."

    "text": "9.6 A Few Tips from Professor Love\n\nStatistics is a “getting the details right” business - we care deeply about details, and this applies to writing code or complete English sentences. RStudio has a spell-checker. To use it, click F7.\nNothing impresses us as much as a clear and concise argument, presented using well-written English sentences, effective and well-labeled figures and tables.\nDon’t parrot back material that Professor Love wrote or said. State ideas in your own words. Stating them in my words is, technically, plagiarism.\nEdit your more adventurous output; don’t present everything you know how to do in R, and don’t forget that someone is trying to read both your code and your results.\nMake your work easy to evaluate. In responding to an assignment, be sure to answer the question that was asked, restating it as necessary.\nClearly label everything: graphs, tables, your answer to a specific question. Everything. Again, make your work easy to evaluate.\nSimplify. Emphasize ideas in plain language. Avoid jargon. Use English well.\nData are plural. Use “the data are …” rather than “the data is …”\nA paragraph must contain more than one sentence.\n\nDon’t switch tenses. If you want to write in the present tense, stick to it throughout.\nDon’t write or say random sample unless you used a random number generator. If you used haphazard sampling or convenience sampling, call it what it is, and indicate whether any problems could have cropped up as a result.\nSimilarly, don’t defend a method of data collection because it is random. Most of the time we want to represent some population, and a random sample is just one way to ensure that certain types of biases have a low probability of creeping in.\nIf you want to write that you used \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) as a significance level, then state that your results were obtained using a 95% confidence level, not a 95% confidence interval, unless you are actually interpreting a confidence interval.\n\nIf you find yourself in the appalling situation of writing about a p-value, then you should state something like:\n\n[1] We’re using a 95% confidence level.\n[2] We’re using a 5% significance level.\n\n[3] We’re using \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\).\n\nDon’t use more than one of these expressions.\n\nAgain, don’t use p-values in most settings, but if you must, refer to all p-values that are less than 0.001 or perhaps less than 0.0001 as \\(p &lt; 0.001\\), rather than, for instance, \\(p = 0.00000001\\) or, worse yet, \\(p = 0\\). In a similar vein, write all \\(p\\)-values that exceed 0.99 as \\(p &gt; 0.99\\) instead of, for instance, \\(p = 1\\).\nTo the extent possible, don’t use computer-ese to label variables, plots or tables. R and Quarto allow you to change the labels on graphs and tables to meaningful things – do so. Use meaningful abbreviations, as necessary, explaining what they mean on the first usage.\nWhen in doubt, err on the side of clarity. Clear thinking leads to clear writing.\n\nFinally, don’t use the phrase “statistically significant” or “statistically detectable” in your writing. It’s not helpful."

For 431, we expect all students to attend at least 80% of the planned classes in person.\n\nIf you need to miss a class session, or even two, just review the materials and move on, and please feel encouraged to ask for help.\nIf you must miss more than two classes in a row, then it is your responsibility to email Professor Love as soon as possible to let him know. There’s no need to let him know about shorter absences.\n\nAn appropriate email would read “I am unable to attend class on [specific dates] and I will complete all necessary work while I am away.” No additional explanation is required."

Professor Love will wear a mask (or pivot to Zoom) if he isn’t feeling well, and will maintain a substantial distance from you when he isn’t doing so.\n\nMultiple students and teaching assistants in this course either care for small children, those suffering with medical problems, or both.\nProfessor Love lost most of July 2022 to COVID-19, and is at high risk, and naturally wants to limit the chances of a recurrence. He also is in a show in February, and really doesn’t want to be sick for that.\n\nWe want you to learn lots of things from this class, but we primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis. We also want to make our classroom space as safe as possible. If you are uncomfortable with this expectation, contact Professor Love immediately."

We expect that all students, instructors and guests will help foster an atmosphere of respect, trust and safety in the classroom.\nIf you have suggestions for how to make the class content or environment more inclusive, or have specific incidents to report, please reach out to Professor Love directly. If you are not comfortable reaching out to him, please feel encouraged to reach out to someone else, such as the School of Medicine Graduate Education Office (som-geo@case.edu) or the Office of Inclusion, Diversity and Equal Opportunity (OIDEO) (oideo@case.edu).

It is easy for your laptop to become a distraction to you and to those around you. Laptops are to be used only when essential to the task at hand. Please turn off or silence all cell/smart phones, tablets, and other electronic devices for the duration of the course. Inappropriate uses will be noted and may affect the final grade.”\n\nProfessor Love adds that, in this class, the use of a laptop or other device is welcomed, and even encouraged, for taking notes on our slides, or following along with the presentation, or trying out ideas in R, but it is inappropriate for you to use such a machine for activities unrelated to the class during our time together. Silence your phone during class. The temptation to look at your phone or Facebook or email during class is nearly irresistible. Resist anyway, if only to avoid distracting your instructor and your fellow students.\nThank you."

    "text": "10.8 Academic Integrity\nHere is the official policy of the University on Academic Integrity.\n\nAny violation of the University’s Code of Ethics will not be tolerated. All forms of academic dishonesty including cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation, and obstruction are violations of academic integrity standards and will result in a minimum penalty of receiving a zero for the assignment, the potential for failing the entire course. Cheating includes copying from another’s work, falsifying problem solutions or laboratory reports, or using unauthorized sources, notes or computer programs. Plagiarism includes the presentation, without proper attribution, of another’s words or ideas from printed or electronic sources. It is also plagiarism to submit, without the instructor’s consent, an assignment in one class previously submitted in another. Misrepresentation includes forgery of official academic documents, the presentation of altered or falsified documents or testimony to a university office or official, taking an exam for another student, or lying about personal circumstances to postpone tests or assignments. Obstruction occurs when a student engages in unreasonable conduct that interferes with another’s ability to conduct scholarly activity. Destroying a student’s computer file, stealing a student’s notebook, and stealing a book on reserve in the library are examples of obstruction. In addition, the incident will be reported to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and Academic Review Board for undergraduates or Senior Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, for Graduate Students.\n\nThe CWRU Statement of Ethics for graduate students can be found here: http://case.edu/gradstudies/about-the-school/policies-procedures/"

Submitting plagiarized work for an academic requirement is a violation of the academic integrity standards set forth by the University. Plagiarism is the representation of another’s work or ideas as one’s own; it includes the unacknowledged, word-for-word use and/or paraphrasing of another person’s work, and/or the inappropriate unacknowledged use of another person’s ideas. Submitting substantially the same work to satisfy requirements for one course that has been submitted in satisfaction of requirements for another course, without permission of the instructor of the course for which the work is being submitted, is also prohibited.\n\nIf you have any questions about this policy as it applies to 431, please direct them to Professor Love."
